## Background Information: 
The title of the research paper is Association between adding salt in food and dementia in European descent: A Mendelian randomization study. It's main authors and contributors were Ren Zhou and Hong Jiang. 

The main goal of this paper is to show causality between high salt intake and dementia. Prior research had already been done that suggested a correlation between these two variables, so this paper wanted to build upon that prior research to show there is in fact a causal relationship between the two variables. The study tests various different types of dementia: Alzheimer's disease, undefined dementia, etc. It also tests the relationship between high salt intake and general cognitive performance/decline. In this paper, the null hypothesis is that salt intake is not causally related with increased risk for dementia. The alternative hypothesis is that salt intake is causally related to increased risk for dementia.
