## Background Information: 
The title of the research paper is "Association between adding salt in food and dementia in European descent: A Mendelian randomization study". You can read the article [here](https://research-ebsco-com.horacemann.idm.oclc.org/c/qideok/viewer/pdf/od3wz6rtdj) - as long as you are on your Horace Mann Account I think. It's main authors and contributors were Ren Zhou and Hong Jiang. 

The main goal of this paper is to show causality between high salt intake and dementia. Prior research had already been done that suggested a correlation between these two variables, so this paper wanted to build upon that prior research to show there is in fact a causal relationship between the two variables. The study tests various different types of dementia: Alzheimer's disease, undefined dementia, etc. It also tests the relationship between high salt intake and general cognitive performance/decline. In this paper, the null hypothesis is that salt intake is not causally related with increased risk for dementia. The alternative hypothesis is that salt intake is causally related to increased risk for dementia. 

## What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

This study used data obtained  from GWAS, which stands for Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These types of studies look at small genetic variations within a huge pool of people in order to associate specific changes in nucleotides within genes to specific traits. These small variations in nucleotides are referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 

The data on the genetic variation of added salt to food was taken from the UK Biobank. The dataset identifier was ‚Äúukb-b-8-12‚Äù. You can access the UK Biobank through [this link](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/.) 
but, after that, when I clicked on "participant login" I got this page:

Without an ID, you cant really go much further so I wasn't able to access this data üòî
