# Data: 

I used data from the [eurostat  database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) and I was particularly interested in indicators relating to climate change. As I was skimming through the different datasets in the database, I came across a dataset recording the global sea pH levels. I am pretty uneducated on the factors contributing to sea pH levels so I was curious whether I could do anything with this dataset to learn more about how it relates to other variables recoreded in the database. In the [description of the sea pH level indicator](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_14_50/default/table?lang=en&category=cli.cli_iad), they write that "An increase of atmospheric CO2 enhances the absorption of CO2 by oceans, which correlates directly with a fall in pH values of the oceans."

Under the topic of climate, there was also a dataset with the net greenhouse gas emissions of every country in the EU (as well as the EU cumulatively) across 42 years. After finding this dataset, my goal became to test whether the statement in the description of the sea pH level dataset was true in the case of countries in the EU (for context, CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gasses). In other words, I wanted to determine whether countries in the EU follow the global trend of having a negative corrolation with sea pH levels. Given that there is already a proven causal relationship between increased greenhouse gasses (specifically CO2), and decreased sea pH levels, determining the corrolation between greenhouse gas emissions in the EU and the global sea pH levels can reveal how much the EU contributes to the global causual relationship with the decreasing global sea pH levels. 

# Cleaning:

The sea pH level data:

This data was nice and simple to deal with (yay!). First, I downloaded it as a tsv from [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_14_50/default/table?lang=en&category=cli.cli_iad). Since it only contained data on the average global sea pH levels for each year, there were only 2 columns! To clean the data, I transposed the data, renamed the columns, made sure to re assign indices and made sure all the recoreded values were numerical. ![image](/assets/img/CleaningDp1.png) The reason I had to transpose the data was so that I would be able to call the .describe() method later on. The .describe() method calculates descriptive statistics on the values by column. Without transposing the data, I would, for example, get the mean of a pH level and a year for every column rather than the mean of all the pH values and the mean of all the years. 

The greenhouse gas emissions data:
I downloaded this dataset from [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_13_10/default/table?lang=en&category=cli.cli_gge) In the greenhouse gas emissions dataset, net greenhouse gas emissions were recoreded using four different metrics. For example, one metrics included aviation over the country while another metric excluded aviation. The data recoreded 28 countries in the EU (back when the UK was included), a few net EU emissions columns (i.e. one with the UK and one without) and four metrics for all of these. So, the greenhouse gas emissions data spanned 124 columns (excluding the column that recorded the years). 

The data cleaning/manipulation was a bit more complicated for this data than the previous one (and there are probably better and more simpler ways to go about it than what I did - but I'm just happy I got it to work). So first, the general cleaning. This part was pretty much the same as for the preiovus dataset. I transposed the data so that the .describe() method would work as I wanted it to, reassigned columns, reassigned indices and made all the values numerical. But then, to graph the scatter plot properly and have different hues by country, I had to do more data stuff ðŸ˜­. This "stuff" entailed switching the data from its current "wide" format to a "long" format. A "wide" format means that it is how you would typically visualize a table. The columns represent the greenhouse gas emissions of various countries and each row stands for a different year. The very first column is dedicated to listing the years. However, to make the scatter plot graphing easier, its ideal for the data to be formatted in a "long" format. This means, the greenhouse gas emissions should have their own column, so that we can specify that that is the y axis on the graph. So, in the "long" form of the dataset, the first column represents the year to country combination and the second column represents the corresponding greenhouse gas emission measurment. I used the "melt" function to do this: ![image] (/assets/img/Dp1Long.png). 

# Analysis: 

Expectation: 
Given that there is a known causal inverse relationship between global greenhouse gas emissions increasing and sea pH levels decreasing, I expected strong negative corrolations between greenhouse gas emissions and sea pH levels. 


Results:

I submitted the summary Satistics of greenhuose gas emissions data and the sea pH level data as a file in my project. They are labled summary1.tsv and summary2.tsv. (1 is the pH levels and 2 is the greenhouse gas emissions data) 

These are the scatter plots of the sea pH level data and the greenhouse gas emissions data:

Since its difficult to tell the trends of individual countries (I got rid of the legend because it covered the entire graph), here is an xample of greenhouse gas emissions of Belgium using the first metric of the emissions:

This is the distribution of the correlation constants across all country and metric combinations:

I thought it would also be interesting to see whether the corrolations of different measures of greenhouse gas emissions had diffferent distributions across the countries. Here are 4 histograms that show the distribution of corrolations depending on the different metric.

The distributions do differ slightly, which means that the metrics of greenhouse gas emissions do make a difference in the correlations, though the general trend remains the same. 

# Conclusion:

My corrolations reveal that the majority of countries in the EU, through various metrics of greenhouse gas emissions, do not inversely corrolate with sea pH levels as I expected. Rather than have a negative corrolation constant, 81/125 measurements of greenhouse gases actually had a corrolation constant above 0.75. While globally, greenhouse gas emissions are increasing, in the EU, for most countries, they are decreasing. This means they have a positive corrolation with sea pH levels, rather than the inverse causual relationship between global greenhouse gas emissions and sea pH levels. This result implies that the driving factor in the decrease of sea pH levels are the greenhouse gas emissions of coutnries outside of the EU. 

# Limitations:

One of the limitations of this dataset was the fact that the way the countries and indicators were labled were a bit confusing. I did not end up changing the country codes in my lab, so I ended up memorizing the relevant ones (like the title of the column that measured the net greenhouse gas emmissions in EU or the title of the  column that measured the greenhouse gas emissions of Austria since its first in the alphabet). 

Another issue with the dataset is that the seapH levels only started being recorded in 2002 while the greenhouse gas emissions started being recorded in 1990 so I had to discard a bunch of greenhouse gas emissions data. If there was data available on the sea pH levels prior to 2002, I would have been able to see whether the corrolation between greenhouse gas emissions and sea pH persists through a larger period of time. 

In issues regarding climate, time is especially important since in 1990, there were far less climate policies and climate urgency than in the more recent years. It would have been interesting to see whether or not there was shift in the EU's contribution to the sea pH levels as the EU enacted more climate change regulations and china industrialized and developed into a greater contributor to the global greenhouse gas emissions.
